Readme file

Documentation (Chapter 10/Assignment 10): README, license, more detailed documentation (markdown) with, e.g., the UML class diagram, but also mention where a
pattern is used, but also some end-user documentation, e.g., on how to run your jar


Design Pattern: Program to Interfaces not implementations
